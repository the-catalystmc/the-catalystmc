## My inner workings and past experiences

Growing up I could always be seen with a book. I remember the first set of books I read were the ones issued at my local primary school in grade one. I later moved on to reading Enid Blyton's compilations, the Harry Potter series, and Lord of the Rings by the age of 9. My classmates normally teased me by saying the books are bigger than I am.  

Through reading I have developed a love for writing, I have written books, screenplays, songs, and now I am expanding my skills to code. Some aspects of programming can be compared to writing a novel. Programming has reinforced that there is more to the art of writing(coding) than grammar(syntax). Pseudo-coding is like creating plot points so that there is always a structure to follow. This helps to make problem-solving easier, as much as how a story would develop. The functions are like individual characters that interact in order to develop the plot. In the end we normally have a piece of software that works like magic similar to a complete book being a wonderful piece of literature.

## Current activities 

Today I am a student at Microverse where I am honing my programming skills. At the same time, I am pursuing my BSc in Computer Science.
I am also open to colloborations and, new opportunities.
