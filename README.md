## My inner workings and past experiences

Growing up I could always be seen with a book. I remember the first set of books I read were the ones issued at my local primary school in grade one. I later moved on to reading Enid Blyton's compilations, the Harry Potter series, and Lord of the Rings by the age of 9. My classmates used to say the books are bigger than I am.  

Through reading I have developed a love for writing, I have written books, screenplays, songs, and now I am expanding my skills to code. Coding has thought me that there is more to the art of writing than grammar(syntax), but there is also a technical side. Critical thinking is one of the most important technical skills. Pseudo-coding is like creating plot points to make problem-solving easier, as much as how a story would develop. The functions are like characters that play their unique roles, and the end product is always a wonderful piece of literature once it starts working.

## Current activities 

Today I am a student at Microverse where I am honing my programming skills. At the same time, I am pursuing my BSc in Computer Science.
I am also open to colloborations and, new job opportunities.

## Misc

I love reading Chinese novels/Xantia. Apart from that, I am a poet, author, and screenwriter.
